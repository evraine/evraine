I am a cognitive neuroscientist exploring the intricate relationships between brain function, memory processes, and musical cognition through advanced neuroimaging techniques. My research leverages computational models and innovative methodologies to uncover the neural mechanisms that underpin memory formation and learning.

My work sits at the interdisciplinary crossroads of neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and music theory, employing fMRI and other neuroimaging tools to investigate how musical stimuli influence memory consolidation and retrieval. I'm particularly interested in how music scaffolds learning complex event series or rules, as well as how music could modulate human emotional memory. Working across multiple research topics, I aim to develop music interventions to improve memory and modulate emotion in both healthy and aging populations.

I received my bachelor's degree from Boston University, studying psychology and neuroscience, followed by my master's and PhD in cognitive brain science from Georgia Institute of Technology. My doctoral research focused on using music to improve visual sequential memory and modulate emotional memory. Through this work, I discovered interesting brain network reconfiguration patterns and enhanced memory processing during learning with musical stimuli.

Currently, I'm investigating additional applications of music in improving memory functions, including spatial memory and associative learning. My goal is to explore music's potential in various settings including educational, clinical, and commercial environments.

Beyond my research, I'm passionate about exercise, traveling, and fashion.
